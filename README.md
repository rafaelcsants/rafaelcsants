# Hi 👋, I'm Rafael Santos

I'm a front-end developer who enjoys building new projects and learning from them. Secretly, I loved Back-end development even before considering working on Front-end, which was one of the things I always avoided during my college years. Now, I have fallen in love with it 🙃

I have experience in JavaScript, ReactJS, TypeScript, and NextJS and i had the opportunity to work on a couple of international projects using these technologies.

My focus is on adopting best practices, writing clean code, and mastering the tools I use. I'm always eager to learn and apply my skills to create effective web applications.

## Technologies/Frameworks and Future Work

- 💻: ReactJS, NextJS, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, tRPC, Prisma, SQL, Git, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3.

- 🔮: Currently exploring and practicing more advanced topics in the newer versions of the frameworks I have been using. In my free time, I am learning Node.JS and Express. 🚧
